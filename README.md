# What Shoud I Do

## Project Description
My simple task management project serves as a tool for grasping the fundamental concepts of React, Express, and MongoDB. Through this project, I've explored and learned how to integrate these technologies to create a functional web application. With a focus on the basics of each technology, I've gained knowledge and practical experience in working with React for the frontend, Express for the backend, and MongoDB for data storage. This straightforward project has helped me solidify my understanding and gain confidence in using these technologies in future projects.

### Technologies Used:

I utilized the following technologies:

- **Node.js**: A runtime environment for server-side JavaScript execution.
- **Express.js**: Backend development, creating APIs and database interactions.
- **MongoDbCompass**: To store some information in the database.
- **React**: A popular web application library known for its effectiveness in creating interactive and dynamic UI components.

  ## Setup

### Server side
#### Install dependencies
```bash
cd server
npm install
```

#### Running the code

```bash
cd server
nodemon server.js
```

It will start the server with nodemon. So it will watch the changes and restart the server if some ot the files changed.

### Client side

#### Install dependencies

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

#### Runnig the code

```bash
cd client
npm start
```
